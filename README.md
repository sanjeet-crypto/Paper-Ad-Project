OUR SOLUTION ---project PRINTOFIA

OUR    IDEA
----------------------------------------------
 THE POTENTIAL EMERGING COMPANIES , STARTUPS AND LOCAL MARKETS CAN REGISTER THEMSELVES ON THE WEBSITE FOR SPONSORSHIPS .
THE PRINTING MARKET SHOPS WILL ALSO REGISTER TO PROVIDE FREE PRINTING SERVICE TO THE STUDENTS .
IN RETURN THE COMPANIES ADVERTISEMENT AND LOGO AND BE PRINTED ON THE FRONTAL OR CORNER SIDES OF THE PAGE WITHOUT DISTURBING THE CONTENT AREA .
IN THIS WAY THE STUDENTS CAN AVAIL FREE PRINTING SERVICE AND COMPANIES CAN ALSO DO THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS AT MINIMAL COSTS .

ADVANTAGES TO THE COMPANIES:-

THE COMPANIES CAN HAVE A GREATER REACH  AND EXCELLENT MARKETING ,AS  YOUTH ARE MAINLY FOUND IN SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES WHO REQUIRE THE MAXIMUM PRINTING SERVICE .
THIS WOULD BE  BOON FOR   THE LOCAL MARKETS.
REDUCE THE MARKETING EXPENDITURE AND INCREASE THE PROFIT DUE TO WIDER REACH.

ADVANTAGES TO THE STUDENTS:-

WILL SOLVE THEIR MONETARY ISSUES .
MAKE THEIR STUDY MORE INTERESTING WITH THE FRESH SMELL OF PAGES OF  PRINTED BOOKS AND NOTES.
MAKE THEM AWARE OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AVAILABLE .
FREE ACCESS TO PRINTING SERVICE.

PROBLEMS FACED:-

CONCLUSION:-

THIS PROJECT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR WIDER SECTION OF SOCIETY  EXTENDING FROM STUDENTS , YOUTH ,…….COMPANIES ETC
THIS IS WOULD BE  THE BEST SOURCE OF SPONSERSHIPS  FOR ALL TYPES OF COMPANIES BE IT EMERGING STARTUPS OR ESTABLISH COMPANIES AND BUSSINESS
THIS WOULD ALSO SOLVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES LIKE GLOBAL WARMING ,POLLUTION ETC AS THE USAGE OF PAPERS WOULD BE REDUCED SO TREES WOULD BE SAVED .
